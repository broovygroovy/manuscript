            <h4 style="margin-left: 170px;"> WRITTEN BY RUBEN PATER </h4>
            <p class="bigger"> There are conflicting theories on whether the cultural meanings of colours can be categorised. Meanings change over time and depend on the context. Black may be the colour of mourning in many countries, though a black book cover or a black poster is not always associated with death. Another example is that brides in China traditionally wear red, but many brides have started to wear white in recent decades. The cultural meaning of colours is not set but always changing. The next few pages list some of the meanings of colours in different cultures.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #5C935E;  margin-top: -80px;"><em style="font-size:100px;">.</em>GREEN</h4>
            <p> is the colour of nature in many cultures. Early rituals centered on the hope of a good harvest with green vegetables. Green is the traditional colour of Islam, the colour of the prophet Muhammed, which is why many flags in the Islamic world use the colour green.

The Tuareg of North Africa wear blue turbans, dyed with indigo. Azure blue is the national colour of Italy, the national soccer team is called the Azzurri.

            <h4 style="color: #B29CF0;  margin-top: -80px;"><em style="font-size:100px;">.</em>PURPLE</h4>

                <p style="max-width: 400px;"> In the canon of design, the text serves as a reminder of the importance of cultural context in design decisions, especially in areas like branding, user interface design, and advertising. Understanding the cultural connotations of colors is crucial in creating designs that resonate with diverse audiences.</p><br>

                <p style="max-width: 400px;"> In contemporary practice of interaction design, the connection of colours and culture remains highly relevant. With the global nature of digital products and services, designers must be mindful of the cultural implications of color choices. A color scheme that is well-received in one culture might have negative connotations in another making it even more important for interaction designers to consider cultural sensitivity when making design decisions.</p><br>

                <p style="max-width: 400px;"> The author effectively conveys that colors carry nuanced cultural meanings, and these meanings are not fixed but evolve over time and across different contexts. The examples provided, such as the shifting bridal attire in China and the varied associations with the color red, vividly illustrate this point. The reading successfully emphasizes the dynamic nature of color symbolism.</p><br>

            <p style="max-width: 400px;"> One aspect that might be subject to disagreement is the assertion that blue is universally liked by all cultures. While blue is generally well-received, there may still be variations in its perceived meaning or emotional impact across different societies. It's important to recognize that even highly popular colors can have nuanced interpretations.</p><br>
            
            <p style="max-width: 400px;"> Colours and Culture teaches the reader the importance of cultural awareness in design, particularly in relation to color choices. It highlights the need for thorough research and consideration of cultural contexts when making design decisions. This knowledge will impact how readers approach design by making me more conscious of the potential cultural implications of color selections and encouraging me to conduct thorough cultural research before finalizing design choices. It reinforces the idea that design is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor and requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse audiences it serves.</p><br>
